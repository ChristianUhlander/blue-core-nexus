# Security Analysis Report - IPS Security Center

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive security analysis of the IPS Security Center application, identifying critical vulnerabilities, security gaps, and providing actionable recommendations for remediation. The analysis covers both the current frontend-only architecture and the proposed FastAPI backend migration.

## Current Architecture Security Assessment

### Critical Security Vulnerabilities

#### 1. Hardcoded API Keys and Credentials (CRITICAL - CVE Risk)
**Severity**: 🔴 Critical  
**Impact**: Complete compromise of integrated security services

**Current Issues:**
```typescript
// VULNERABLE: Hardcoded credentials in client-side code
const WAZUH_API_KEY = "your-wazuh-api-key";
const GVM_USERNAME = "admin";
const GVM_PASSWORD = "admin123";
const ZAP_API_KEY = "your-zap-key";
const SPIDERFOOT_API_KEY = "your-spiderfoot-key";
```

**Risk Assessment:**
- API keys exposed in browser developer tools
- Credentials visible in source code and build artifacts
- No key rotation mechanism
- Potential for credential stuffing attacks
- Complete unauthorized access to security infrastructure

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Remove all hardcoded credentials from client-side code
2. Implement backend API gateway for credential management
3. Use environment variables on server-side only
4. Implement API key rotation mechanism
5. Audit all repositories for exposed credentials

#### 2. Direct Client Access to Internal Services (HIGH)
**Severity**: 🟠 High  
**Impact**: Bypass of security controls and potential lateral movement

**Current Issues:**
- Frontend directly connects to Wazuh, GVM, ZAP, SpiderFoot
- No authentication layer between client and services
- Internal network topology exposed to clients
- CORS policies may be overly permissive

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct service enumeration
- API abuse and DoS attacks
- Unauthorized scan initiation
- Data exfiltration from security tools

#### 3. Insecure Authentication and Authorization (HIGH)
**Severity**: 🟠 High  
**Impact**: Unauthorized access to security platform

**Current Issues:**
- No user authentication mechanism
- No role-based access control (RBAC)
- No session management
- No audit logging for security events

**Missing Security Controls:**
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

## Migration Security Recommendations

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Remove All Hardcoded Credentials**
   ```bash
   # Audit for exposed secrets
   git log --all --full-history -- "**/*" | grep -i -E "(password|key|token|secret)"
   
   # Use tools like truffleHog or GitLeaks
   truffleHog --regex --entropy=False /path/to/repo
   ```

2. **Implement Backend API Gateway**
   ```python
   # FastAPI with proper authentication
   from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
   from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer
   
   security = HTTPBearer()
   
   @app.middleware("http")
   async def security_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
       # Implement security checks
       return await call_next(request)
   ```

3. **Environment-Based Configuration**
   ```python
   # Secure configuration management
   from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
   
   class Settings(BaseSettings):
       wazuh_api_key: str
       gvm_username: str
       gvm_password: str
       
       class Config:
           env_file = ".env"
           env_file_encoding = "utf-8"
   ```

### Phase 2: Authentication Implementation (Week 2)

1. **JWT-Based Authentication**
   ```python
   from fastapi_users import FastAPIUsers
   from fastapi_users.authentication import JWTAuthentication
   
   SECRET = "your-secret-key"
   jwt_authentication = JWTAuthentication(secret=SECRET, lifetime_seconds=3600)
   ```

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   ```python
   from enum import Enum
   
   class UserRole(str, Enum):
       ADMIN = "admin"
       ANALYST = "analyst"
       VIEWER = "viewer"
   
   def require_role(required_role: UserRole):
       def role_checker(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
           if current_user.role != required_role:
               raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Insufficient permissions")
           return current_user
       return role_checker
   ```

### Phase 3: Secure Communications (Week 3)

1. **TLS Everywhere**
   ```python
   # Force HTTPS
   from fastapi.middleware.httpsredirect import HTTPSRedirectMiddleware
   
   app.add_middleware(HTTPSRedirectMiddleware)
   ```

2. **Secure WebSocket Implementation**
   ```python
   @app.websocket("/ws/security-alerts")
   async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket, token: str = Query(...)):
       user = await verify_websocket_token(token)
       if not user:
           await websocket.close(code=4001)
           return
       # Implement secure WebSocket logic
   ```

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Auditing (Week 4)

1. **Comprehensive Audit Logging**
   ```python
   import structlog
   
   logger = structlog.get_logger()
   
   @app.middleware("http")
   async def audit_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
       start_time = time.time()
       response = await call_next(request)
       
       logger.info(
           "API request",
           method=request.method,
           url=str(request.url),
           status_code=response.status_code,
           duration=time.time() - start_time
       )
       return response
   ```

2. **Security Event Monitoring**
   ```python
   async def log_security_event(event_type: str, user_id: str, details: dict):
       await security_logger.warning(
           "Security event detected",
           event_type=event_type,
           user_id=user_id,
           details=details,
           timestamp=datetime.utcnow()
       )

## Conclusion

The IPS Security Center application currently has significant security vulnerabilities that pose serious risks to the organization and its data. The most critical issues are the hardcoded credentials and direct client access to security services, which require immediate attention.

The recommended migration to a FastAPI backend with proper authentication, authorization, and security controls will significantly improve the security posture. However, this migration must be executed with security as a primary consideration throughout the development process.

Implementation of the recommended security measures should be prioritized based on risk assessment and available resources, with critical vulnerabilities addressed immediately and comprehensive security controls implemented during the backend migration.

Regular security assessments, penetration testing, and compliance audits should be conducted to maintain and improve the security posture over time.
