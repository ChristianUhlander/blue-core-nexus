# QA Report - IPS Security Center

## Executive Summary

**Overall Status**: üü† **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**  
**Test Date**: 2024-01-30  
**Environment**: Development Frontend  
**Reviewer**: AI Security Analyst  

This comprehensive QA analysis identifies critical security vulnerabilities, functionality gaps, and architectural concerns that require immediate attention before any production deployment.

## Critical Findings

### üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES

#### 1. Backend Service Failures
**Status**: All security services offline  
**Impact**: Complete loss of security monitoring functionality

**Test Results**:
```
‚ùå Wazuh: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource (Failed after 4 attempts)
‚ùå GVM: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource (Failed after 4 attempts) 
‚ùå ZAP: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource (Failed after 4 attempts)
‚ùå SpiderFoot: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource (Failed after 4 attempts)
‚ùå WebSocket: backend WebSocket error (Connection failed)
```

**Root Cause**: No actual backend services deployed
**Recommendation**: Deploy FastAPI backend with real security service integrations

#### 2. Hardcoded Security Credentials
**Severity**: üî¥ Critical CVE Risk  
**Location**: `src/services/securityIntegrationService.ts` lines 180-206

**Exposed Secrets**:
```typescript
username: import.meta.env?.VITE_WAZUH_USERNAME || 'wazuh',
password: import.meta.env?.VITE_WAZUH_PASSWORD || 'wazuh',
username: import.meta.env?.VITE_GVM_USERNAME || 'admin', 
password: import.meta.env?.VITE_GVM_PASSWORD || 'admin',
apiKey: import.meta.env?.VITE_ZAP_API_KEY || '',
apiKey: import.meta.env?.VITE_SPIDERFOOT_API_KEY || '',
```

**Risk Assessment**:
- Default credentials visible in source code
- Environment variables exposed to client-side
- No credential rotation mechanism
- Potential unauthorized access to security infrastructure

**Immediate Action Required**: Remove all client-side credentials

### üü† HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

#### 3. Component Architecture - Monolithic Design
**Issue**: SecurityDashboard component is 6,419 lines
**Impact**: Maintainability, testing, and performance concerns

**Refactoring Required**:
- Break into smaller, focused components
- Separate business logic from UI logic
- Implement proper state management
- Create reusable security widgets

#### 4. Missing Authentication & Authorization
**Issue**: No user authentication mechanism
**Impact**: Unrestricted access to security controls

**Missing Features**:
- User login/logout system
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management
- API route protection

#### 5. Insecure Client-Side Configuration
**Issue**: Security service URLs and credentials in frontend
**Impact**: Internal network topology exposure

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

#### 6. Error Handling Quality
**Status**: ‚úÖ Well implemented circuit breaker pattern
**Observation**: Good resilience handling for service failures

#### 7. Real-time Data Management
**Status**: ‚úÖ WebSocket integration properly structured
**Observation**: Event-driven architecture well designed

#### 8. TypeScript Implementation
**Status**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive type definitions
**Observation**: Strong typing throughout codebase
